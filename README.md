**Introduction**

Climate change and economic development are critical topics worldwide, especially for developing countries like Nigeria. This project focuses on analyzing:
	•	Nigeria’s CO2 emission trends.
	•	The impact of population growth on emissions.
	•	The correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions.

**Dataset**

The data was sourced from:
	•	Our World in Data (OWID)
	•	World Bank Open Data

Key variables include:
	•	CO2 emissions
	•	Population 
	•	GDP 

**Features of the Analysis**
	•	Time-series analysis of CO2 emissions.
	•	Trend comparison between population growth and CO2 emissions.
	•	Correlation analysis of GDP growth and CO2 emissions.
	•	Visualizations using Python libraries.

**Technologies Used**
	•	Python: For data analysis and visualization.
	•	Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
	•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization.
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis.

******Installation and Usage**
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/analysis-co2-emissions-nigeria.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd analysis-co2-emissions-nigeria

**Results and Visualizations**

The analysis provides:
	•	Graphs showing the trend of CO2 emissions over time.
	•	Insights into how population and GDP influence emissions.
	•	Policy implications for sustainable growth in Nigeria.
