Introduction

Climate change and economic development are critical topics worldwide, especially for developing countries like Nigeria. This project focuses on analyzing:
	•	Nigeria’s CO2 emission trends.
	•	The impact of population growth on emissions.
	•	The correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions.

Dataset

The data was sourced from:
	•	Our World in Data (OWID)
	•	World Bank Open Data

Key variables include:
	•	CO2 emissions
	•	Population 
	•	GDP 

Features of the Analysis
	•	Time-series analysis of CO2 emissions.
	•	Trend comparison between population growth and CO2 emissions.
	•	Correlation analysis of GDP growth and CO2 emissions.
	•	Visualizations using Python libraries.

Technologies Used
	•	Python: For data analysis and visualization.
	•	Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
	•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization.
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis.
